The easiest way to learn how to use Amazon Lex is by using the console\. To get you started, we created the following exercises, all of which use the console:
+ Exercise 1 — Create an Amazon Lex bot using a blueprint, a predefined bot that provides all of the necessary bot configuration\. You do only a minimum of work to test the end\-to\-end setup\.
+ Exercise 2 — Review the JSON structures sent between your client application and an Amazon Lex bot\.
