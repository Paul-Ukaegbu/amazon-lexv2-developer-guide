Amazon Lex provides API operations that you can integrate with your existing applications\. For a list of supported operations, see the [API reference](API_Reference.md)\. You can use any of the following options:
+ AWS SDK — When using the SDKs your requests to Amazon Lex are automatically signed and authenticated using the credentials that you provide\. We recommend that you use an SDK to build your application\.
+ AWS CLI — You can use the AWS CLI to access any Amazon Lex feature without having to write any code\.
+ AWS Console — The console is the easiest way to get started testing and using Amazon Lex 

 If you are new to Amazon Lex, we recommend that you read [How it works](how-it-works.md) first\.
