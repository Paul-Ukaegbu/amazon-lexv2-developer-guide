# Exporting a bot \(console\)<a name="export-console"></a>

You can export a bot from the bot list, from the list of versions, or from the version details page\. When you choose a version, Amazon Lex exports that version\. The following instructions assume that you start exporting the bot from the list of bots, but when you start with a version the steps are the same\.
