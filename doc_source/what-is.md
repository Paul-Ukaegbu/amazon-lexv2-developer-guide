# What is Amazon Lex V2?<a name="what-is"></a>

Amazon Lex V2 is an AWS service for building conversational interfaces for applications using voice and text\. Amazon Lex V2 provides the deep functionality and flexibility of natural language understanding \(NLU\) and automatic speech recognition \(ASR\) so you can build highly engaging user experiences with lifelike, conversational interactions, and create new categories of products\.

Amazon Lex V2 enables any developer to build conversational bots quickly\. With Amazon Lex V2, no deep learning expertise is necessary—to create a bot, you specify the basic conversation flow in the Amazon Lex V2 console\. Amazon Lex V2 manages the dialog and dynamically adjusts the responses in the conversation\. Using the console, you can build, test, and publish your text or voice chatbot\. You can then add the conversational interfaces to bots on mobile devices, web applications, and chat platforms \(for example, Facebook Messenger\)\. 

Amazon Lex V2 provides integration with AWS Lambda, and you can integrate with many other services on the AWS platform, including Amazon Connect, Amazon Comprehend, and Amazon Kendra\. Integration with Lambda provides bots access to pre\-built serverless enterprise connectors to link to data in SaaS applications such as Salesforce\.



Amazon Lex V2 provides the following benefits:
+ **Simplicity** – Amazon Lex V2 guides you through using the console to create your own bot in minutes\. You supply a few example phrases, and Amazon Lex V2 builds a complete natural language model through which the bot can interact using voice and text to ask questions, get answers, and complete sophisticated tasks\.

   
+  **Democratized deep learning technologies** – Amazon Lex V2 provides ASR and NLU technologies to create a Speech Language Understanding \(SLU\) system\. Through SLU, Amazon Lex V2 takes natural language speech and text input, understands the intent behind the input, and fulfills the user intent by invoking the appropriate business function\. 

   

  Speech recognition and natural language understanding are some of the most challenging problems to solve in computer science, requiring sophisticated deep learning algorithms to be trained on massive amounts of data and infrastructure\. Amazon Lex V2 puts deep learning technologies within reach of all developers\. Amazon Lex V2 bots convert incoming speech to text and understand the user intent to generate an intelligent response so you can focus on building your bots with added value for your customers and define entirely new categories of products made possible through conversational interfaces\.

You can take advantage of the power of the AWS platform for security, monitoring, user authentication, business logic, storage, and mobile app development\.

   
+ **Cost\-effectiveness** – With Amazon Lex V2, there are no upfront costs or minimum fees\. You are charged only for the text or speech requests that are made\.
